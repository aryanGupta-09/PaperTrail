# PaperTrail

The project aims to develop an integrated information system that enables researchers, professionals, and innovators to efficiently discover relevant research papers and patents, and connect with domain experts. By consolidating multiple databases, this system reduces the manual effort of searching scattered information, streamlining the research and development process.


## Use-cases/Close-to-Real Applications

1) Enhanced Literature Discovery: Finding relevant research articles, journals, etc. based on some keywords.
   1) This can help understanding the research domain and existing work better
   2) Can help with finding relevant citations to support oneâ€™s work

2) Patent Exploration and Analysis: Checking for patents in a particular domain.
   1) An existing patent can affect the decision to create a product or service in that area.
   2) Approaching patent holders with the intention of buying their patents.

3) Expert Networking and Collaboration: The application can recommend researchers one can approach for a particular area of interest. This can be based on factors like:
   1) Recent papers in that domain
   2) Number of citations and their impact
   3) Total number of patents

4) Get Answers for Complex Queries: We can remove a laborious search by giving answers from multiple databases for complex and practically significant queries.
E.g. Give me a list of all the Professors of IIIT-Delhi who have more than 4 research publications in A Star Conferences and at least one Patent.


## Stakeholders

1) Academic Researchers (Students & Professors): Find literature, connect with experts, identify research gaps, and stay updated for collaboration and research support.

2) Industry Researchers and Engineers: Access patents, papers, and collaborators to drive product development, innovation, and strategic planning.

3) Businessmen and Entrepreneurs: Identify emerging technologies, assess market opportunities, and engage with researchers for business ventures.
